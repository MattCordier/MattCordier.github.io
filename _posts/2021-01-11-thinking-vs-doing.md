The start of the year is a popular time for reflection and setting goals. Lose 20lbs. Record an album. Grow your client base by X amount. Read two books a month...

We all start with good intentions. Aside from the occasional stroke of luck, attaining our goals usually takes dedicated effort. 

Our resolutions won't resolve themselves. We will get stuck, feel overwhelmed, or just give in to laziness. To overcome, we need strategies...tools...something to help keep our targets in sight. Something to help us _take action._   

### Stupid Mistake, Simple Insight

I had an epiphany about action a while back. My wife and I needed a babysitter for the weekend. So, I made a mental list of all our potential sitters, considered their typical schedules, and planned to call the ones who may have been available. 

As each day passed, I thought about making the calls. A few times I even said out loud, "I'll be sure to call (X) today." Well, come Saturday, no phone calls were made and I was desperate to find someone! 

The plan was clear. I had all the time I needed to act...but I didn't. That's when it struck me—so basic, so clear, and a bit silly. _Thinking_ and _saying_ does not equal _doing_.

Admittedly, I'm a dreamer _and_ a habitual procrastinator. I love to think, research, and discuss ideas but when it comes to getting things done...follow through is not a strength. I need something concrete to keep me focused. 

Below are three tools that help me stay on target and active. The first two are simple and can be applied immediately. The third is an approach to managing progress on bigger projects over longer timelines.

### #1 The 5 Minute Rule

This one was given to me by my drum teacher, [Mark Walker](https://www.markwalkerlessons.com/about){:target="_blank"}. I was having trouble getting started on transcribing a Roy Haynes solo on the tune _Snap Crackle_. The solo wasn't too difficult but I had never developed a habit for transcription. Each time I thought about getting to work it felt like a huge effort. I kept putting it off. After several weeks of meager progress, Mark patiently suggested—Why don't you just give it five minutes a day?

_Only 5 minutes?_ Yep.

It's a clever trick. Committing only five minutes takes away any pressure to get a ton of work done _and_ it helps create traction on those projects that are outside of your comfort zone. Plus, it's easy to find 5 minutes in even the busiest schedules.

After focusing for five minutes you may feel like you've hit your limit. It's ok to stop and pick it up the next day.

However, once you get beyond the initial starting block, you may find yourself in a groove and keep working well beyond your five minute mark.

### #2 The Ace of Practice

The next idea comes directly from one of my favorite books on making music, [The Listening Book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/659361.Listening_Book){:target="_blank"} by W.A. Mathieu. 

In one chapter, The Ace of Practice, W.A. Mathieu lays out a simple, powerful way to set your intention.

Mathieu states:
> Make a no-nonsense deal with yourself to write down—the night before—the time you intend to practice the next day, and for how long.

Simple, right?

That could look like "Mon 12pm, 5 minutes" or "Sat 10am, 1 hour."

Then be sure to put that note in a place where you will see it the next morning. The act of writing it down is the "ace up your sleeve" and solidifies your intention. You have already taken action towards your goal and are more likely to honor that commitment your made to yourself.

### #3 Plan a Sprint

For bigger projects, it makes sense to have a broader plan and refine it periodically. 

In my experience, musical projects seemed to develop in a less than straightforward path. "Hey man, you wanna jam sometime?" leads to "We should start a band" which may develop into writing songs, booking shows, releasing recorded material, or even booking a tour. The organic nature of the process can a bit murky but is loads of fun.

The corporate world, with its budgets, quarterly reports, and hierarchy of accountability demands a more transparent overview of what's happening.

The two approaches are often felt to be at odds with one another. Without risk of crushing any souls, creative pursuits can take some cues from corporate life and benefit from the discipline of a clear, concise plan. Enter The Sprint.

The software company, Atlassian, defines a sprint as follows:

> A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. 

If you are unfamiliar with the term _scrum_ just think of it as a framework for managing complex projects. It's worth diving into the details if you are so inclined. [Atlassian - Scrum](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum){:target="_blank"} is a fantastic resource. But for now, let's stay focused on the sprint.

Sprints are short—but not _too_ short. One week minimum. It's quite common for them to last two - three weeks.

Sprints are limited in focus to a "set amount of work." Generally speaking, whatever is to be accomplished should stand on its own—even if it is part of a larger project. 

Say you are making an online course. One sprint could focus on all the tasks involved in creating a landing page and composing the email sequence for your launch. The next sprint might focus on script writing for each module. The following sprint could tackle video production, and so on. 

Or, you may want to learn recording. Sprint 1 could consist of researching, selecting, and purchasing an interface. Sprint 2 could be centered on choosing a DAW, installing it, and learning its basic functionality. Sprint 3 might focus on learning the chord progression to a tune you are tracking and experimenting with miking techniques. Get the picture?

The idea here is that you are clear on the tasks you want to accomplish in the time frame of the sprint _and_ you understand how those tasks support the bigger arc of the project.

A common tool for managing your progress during a sprint is a program called Trello. Trello allows you to create a list of tasks and track their progression from idea to completion. To do this you establish columns or "swim lanes" for the life cycle of a task. As you select and complete your work, the task moves through the columns.

Here's an example of the Trello board for my website:

<img src="/public/img/blog-content/trello-board-example.png" alt="Trello Board example" class="img-responsive">

You can see there is a general _Backlog_ that resembles a To-Do list. Before a sprint begins, you select items from this list based on your goal for the sprint. They get moved into the _Sprint Backlog_ column. Those items become your focus for the duration of the sprint. If you get other notions or uncover non-critical issues don't get derailed. Just make a card for them and toss it into your general backlog. You'll revisit them in the next cycle of work. 

The item you're currently working on is moved to the _In Progress_ column. Ideally, there is only one item in this column at a time. In reality, work gets messy. So, it's okay to have a couple plates spinning as long as you keep making forward progress.

Once a task is finished, slide it over to the _Sprint Complete_ column. Take a moment to revel in satisfaction of your accomplishment. Then pick your next task and get back to work.

Hopefully by the end of the sprint you have two empty columns, a list of completed tasks, and a backlog brimming with ideas for your next sprint.

### Wrapping It Up

Remember, thinking and saying does not equal doing. 

If you're having trouble getting started, try the 5 Minute Rule. If you aren't showing up consistently, apply the Ace of Practice. When you have a complex project, break it down into smaller tasks, pick a few related tasks, and focus exclusively on them for the next two weeks. Use a tool like Trello to help you store ideas and track your progress.

Try these techniques out for a month or two and let me know how it goes. Hopefully you'll find yourself energized, organized, and actively pursuing the things you've been dreaming about for years.
